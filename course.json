            "overview": "Biochemistry underpins the very nature of our existence and acquiring skills and knowledge of this subject will help you solve key biological problems. Our Biochemistry degree is aimed at helping you understand the interconnectedness of chemistry, physics and biology by exploring a range of different topics. This includes protein – protein interactions, recognising how macromolecular structure is closely linked to biological function and how this is perturbed in disease. You will find this biochemistry course has a unique blend of biochemistry related topics including genetics, microbiology, physiology and chemistry. You can also specialise in more focused areas including thermodynamics, molecular geometry as well as medical and industrial applications of biochemistry.",
            "highlights": "<ul><li>Modules designed to help you achieve the highest levels of understanding.</li><li>Collaborations with the life science sector for industrial application.</li><li>Practice and practical application sessions for a more engaging experience.</li><li>Global specialists to talk through highly specialized skills.</li><li>Elective modules that allow you to shape your own active blended learning experience.</li><li>HP laptop and software included with this course for eligible students (see Eligibility criteria and terms and conditions).</li></ul>",
            "course_details": "<h3>Year 1</h3><p>In the first year of our biochemistry degree, you explore bond formation and dissociation, energy storage and transfer, and the structure and function of macromolecules. You also develop your practical skills as a biochemist engaging in laboratory-based learning and work with qualitative and quantitative biochemical data.</p><h3>Year 2</h3><p>In the second year, our processes of life module provides a conceptual approach to biochemistry while pure chemistry offers a more mathematical understanding. You then begin to develop your research proposals for your final year dissertation project.</p><h3>Year 3</h3><p>In the final year of this biochemistry course, you will do an independent dissertation project supervised by an academic tutor. In addition, you can explore contemporary issues in biochemistry and how diagnostic tests are applied in clinical contexts. If you are particularly interested in genetics, you might follow a bespoke pathway. That could start with which starts with ‘genetics and molecular biology’ in the first year before advancing to ‘genes and genomics’ in the second year and then completing your final year with medical genetics. Our Microbiology theme includes ‘Introduction to microbiology’ in your first year, Techniques in molecular biology in your second year and then pathogen biology in your final year. There are also additional optional modules that can be undertaken which include immunology, pharmacology, neuroscience as well as a placement module.</p><p>Please note the modules shown here relate to the academic year 23/24. The modules relating to the academic year 24/25 will be available from June 2024.</p>",
