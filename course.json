Our Biochemistry degree is aimed at helping you understand the interconnectedness of chemistry, physics and biology by exploring a range of different topics. This includes protein – protein interactions, recognising how macromolecular structure is closely linked to biological function and how this is perturbed in disease. You will find this biochemistry course has a unique blend of biochemistry related topics including genetics, microbiology, physiology and chemistry. You can also specialise in more focused areas including thermodynamics, molecular geometry as well as medical and industrial applications of biochemistry.",
