# Msc-Internet-Security

## Overview
This repository contains multiple unique projects related to Internet Security as part of the MSc program. Each project represents a final exam task that I excelled in, showcasing advanced and challenging assignments completed within a short time frame. These projects highlight my capability to go beyond the original requirements through additional research and refinement.

## Projects
Below is a list of unique projects in this repository. Each project is licensed under the MIT License, except for the AI Firewall project, which is not open-sourced due to security concerns.

### List of Projects
- [Computer Networks (CPT Design)](Computer Networks (CPT Design))
  - Description: This project involved designing a Cisco Packet Tracer network for a company of approximately 400 people. The design included VLANs, VTP, IP addressing schemes, a dedicated DHCP server setup, NAT/PAT, HSRP, and ACL.
  - [LICENSE](Computer Networks (CPT Design)/LICENSE.txt)
- [Internet Programming (Web API)](Internet Programming (Web API))
  - Description: This project had two tasks. The first task involved handling JSON and JSON schemas, designing a database based on a strict data set, and migrating that data into a MySQL database with CRUD capabilities and charts. The second task included providing a login form.
  - [LICENSE](Internet Programming (Web API)/LICENSE.txt)
- [Internet Security (AI Firewall)](Internet Security (AI Firewall))
  - Description: I created and trained an AI firewall to complement an existing one (fail2ban). The AI analyzed Apache2 log files to detect and respond to unusual activity, banning suspicious IPs and generating notifications. This project was inspired by SIEM applications and trained with over 2 million data sets. **Note:** This project is not open-sourced.
- [Modern Computer Architecture (Arduino)](Modern Computer Architecture (Arduino))
  - Description: This project involved designing two systems in Tinkercad. The first was a Christmas decoration lighting system optimized for power and CPU efficiency. The second was a pedestrian streetlight system with buttons and logic. Both designs were converted into direct port manipulation to compare speed and efficiency.
  - [LICENSE](Modern Computer Architecture (Arduino)/LICENSE.txt)
- [Object Software (Java Program)](Object Software (Java Program))
  - Description: This project required creating an ERP-like system in Java for an electricity company. It involved handling client data using CSV sheets, tracking payments, records, and power consumption per client, which presented a significant challenge compared to using a database.
  - [LICENSE](Object Software (Java Program)/LICENSE.txt)
