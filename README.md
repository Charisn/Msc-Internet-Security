### Project 1: Computer Networks (CPT Design)
**Description:**
This project involved designing a comprehensive network for a company with approximately 400 employees using Cisco Packet Tracer. The design incorporated various advanced networking concepts and techniques, including:
- VLANs
- VTP
- IP Addressing Schemes
- Dedicated DHCP Server Setup
- NAT/PAT
- HSRP
- ACL

### Project 2: Internet Programming (Web API)
**Description:**
This project consisted of two tasks focused on web API development:
1. **JSON and JSON Schemas:** Design a database based on a strict set of data, handling JSON and JSON schemas.
2. **Database Migration and Analysis:** Migrate JSON data into a MySQL database, providing CRUD capabilities and data visualization through charts, along with a user login form.

**License:** [MIT License](Internet Programming (Web API)/LICENSE.txt)

### Project 3: Internet Security (AI Firewall)
**Description:**
In this project, I developed and trained an AI firewall to enhance my existing firewall (fail2ban). The AI analyzed Apache2 log files to detect and respond to unusual activity, automatically banning suspicious IPs and generating notifications. The project was inspired by SIEM applications and trained with over 2 million data sets.

**Note:** This project is not open-sourced due to security concerns.

### Project 4: Modern Computer Architecture (Arduino)
**Description:**
This project involved designing two systems using Tinkercad:
1. **Christmas Decoration Lighting System:** Optimized for power and CPU efficiency.
2. **Pedestrian Streetlight System:** Designed with button controls and logic. Both designs were converted into direct port manipulation for improved speed and efficiency.

**License:** [MIT License](Modern Computer Architecture (Arduino)/LICENSE.txt)

### Project 5: Object Software (Java Program)
**Description:**
This project required the development of an ERP-like system in Java for an electricity company. The system managed client data using CSV files, tracking payments, records, and power consumption per client, which posed a significant challenge compared to traditional database management.

**License:** [MIT License](Object Software (Java Program)/LICENSE.txt)
